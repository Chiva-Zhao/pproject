# The Power of Deep Learning
# The idea of Deep Learning is to use multiple hidden layers to learn latent and complex data patterns,
# relationships, and representations to build a model that learns and generalizes well on the underlying
# data. Letâ€™s take the previous example and convert it to a fully connected deep neural network (DNN)
# by introducing two more hidden layers. The following snippet builds and trains a DNN with the same
# configuration as our previous experiment only with the addition of two new hidden layers.
